The Directory Services Account (DSA) in Microsoft Defender for Identity (MDI) is used for several critical functions, including:

- Connecting to the domain controller at startup.
- Querying the domain controller for data on entities seen in network traffic, monitored events, and monitored ETW activities.
- Requesting member lists for local administrator groups from devices via a SAM-R call.
- Accessing the DeletedObjects container to collect information about deleted users and computers.
- Domain and trust mapping, which occurs at sensor startup and every 10 minutes thereafter.
- Querying another domain via LDAP for details when detecting activities from entities in those domains1.

A DSA is required for full security coverage in MDI. Without a DSA, you may expose your environment to certain risks, such as:

- Inability to fully monitor and analyze activities on your network, which could lead to undetected security breaches.
- Lack of detailed information about deleted objects, which could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access.
- Insufficient data to calculate potential lateral movement paths, which are crucial for identifying compromised accounts and preventing further spread of an attack within the network.

&#128210; &#9888; Not having a DSA in MDI can limit the visibility and control over your network’s security, potentially leaving it vulnerable to undetected attacks. It’s recommended to configure a DSA for comprehensive protection1.
