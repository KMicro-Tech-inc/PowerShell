The Directory Services Account (DSA) in Microsoft Defender for Identity (MDI) is used for several critical functions, including:

&#128073; Connecting to the domain controller at startup.
&#128073; Querying the domain controller for data on entities seen in network traffic, monitored events, and monitored ETW activities.
&#128073; Requesting member lists for local administrator groups from devices via a SAM-R call.
&#128073; Accessing the DeletedObjects container to collect information about deleted users and computers.
&#128073; Domain and trust mapping, which occurs at sensor startup and every 10 minutes thereafter.
&#128073; Querying another domain via LDAP for details when detecting activities from entities in those domains1.

A DSA is required for full security coverage in MDI. Without a DSA, you may expose your environment to certain risks, such as:

&#128549; Inability to fully monitor and analyze activities on your network, which could lead to undetected security breaches.
&#128551; Lack of detailed information about deleted objects, which could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access.
&#128561; Insufficient data to calculate potential lateral movement paths, which are crucial for identifying compromised accounts and preventing further spread of an attack within the network.

&#9888; Not having a DSA in MDI can limit the visibility and control over your network’s security, potentially leaving it vulnerable to undetected attacks. It’s recommended to configure a DSA for comprehensive protection1.
